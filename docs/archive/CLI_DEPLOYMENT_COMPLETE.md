# Vextir OS CLI - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Vextir OS CLI has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive command-line interface that provides full access to the Vextir AI Operating System functionality, replacing the need for the integrated UI for most operations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- **Azure CLI Integration**: Seamless authentication using existing Azure CLI credentials
- **User Information**: Display current user, subscription, and tenant details
- **Automatic Token Management**: Handles Azure authentication tokens automatically

```bash

vextir auth whoami

# Login (verifies Azure CLI authentication)
vextir auth login
```

### 2. Event Management
- **Event Emission**: Send events to the Vextir OS event bus
- **Event Listing**: View recent events with filtering options
- **Real-time Streaming**: Stream events as they occur
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Table, JSON, and tree views

```bash
# Emit an event
vextir event emit test.cli.event --metadata '{"message": "Hello from CLI"}'

# List recent events
vextir event list --limit 20 --type user.action

# Stream events in real-time
vextir event stream --source cli
```

### 3. Driver Management
- **Driver Listing**: View all registered drivers with status
- **Driver Control**: Start and stop drivers
- **Status Monitoring**: Get detailed driver status and metrics
- **Configuration**: Pass configuration to drivers

```bash
# List all drivers
vextir driver list

# Start a driver with configuration
vextir driver start email_agent --config '{"enabled": true}'

# Get driver status
vextir driver status email_agent
```

### 4. Model Management
- **Model Discovery**: List available AI models
- **Model Information**: Get detailed model specifications
- **Provider Filtering**: Filter by provider or capability
- **Cost Information**: View pricing for input/output tokens

```bash
# List all models
vextir model list

# Get detailed model info
vextir model info gpt-4-turbo

# Filter by provider
vextir model list --provider openai
```

### 5. Context Hub Operations (Basic)
- **Content Access**: Read and write to the context hub
- **SQL Queries**: Query context using SQL syntax
- **Metadata Management**: Handle content metadata

```bash
# Read from context hub
vextir context read /system/config

# Write to context hub
vextir context write /user/notes "My notes" --metadata '{"type": "text"}'

# Query context
vextir context query "SELECT * FROM documents WHERE type='email'"
```

### 6. Context Hub Integration (Full CLI)
- **Complete SubCLI**: Full contexthub-cli integration as `vextir hub`
- **User Store Auto-Creation**: Automatic initialization of user-specific stores
- **Local Development Workflow**: Git-like pull/push operations
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Sharing and auto-sync capabilities
- **Unified Authentication**: Seamless Azure CLI integration

```bash
# Initialize your Context Hub store
vextir hub init

# Navigate and explore
vextir hub ls /projects
vextir hub cd projects
vextir hub cat README.md

# Local development workflow
vextir hub pull /projects/myproject ./local-project
# ... work locally ...
vextir hub push ./local-project

# Collaboration
vextir hub share /projects/alpha colleague@company.com --write
vextir hub auto-sync ./local-project
```

### 7. Tool Management
- **Tool Discovery**: List available tools and capabilities
- **Tool Information**: Get detailed tool specifications
- **Status Monitoring**: Check tool availability and status

```bash
# List all tools
vextir tool list

# Filter by capability
vextir tool list --capability web.search
```

### 8. Instruction Management
- **Instruction Listing**: View user instructions
- **Instruction Execution**: Execute instructions programmatically
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor instruction execution status

```bash
# List instructions
vextir instruction list

# Execute an instruction
vextir instruction execute daily-summary
```

### 9. System Management
- **System Status**: Get overall system health and metrics
- **Component Monitoring**: Check individual component status
- **Metrics Access**: View detailed system metrics

```bash
# Get system status
vextir system status

# Get detailed metrics
vextir system metrics
```

### 10. Configuration Management
- **Configuration Access**: View and modify CLI configuration
- **Environment Setup**: Configure endpoints and authentication
- **Persistent Settings**: Save configuration across sessions

```bash
# View all configuration
vextir config get

# Set configuration value
vextir config set endpoint https://my-vextir.azurewebsites.net

# Delete configuration key
vextir config delete auth.tenant_id
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main CLI (`main.py`)**: Entry point with all command definitions
2. **Client (`client.py`)**: HTTP client for API communication
3. **Configuration (`config.py`)**: Configuration management system
4. **Utilities (`utils.py`)**: Helper functions and decorators

### Key Features

- **Rich UI**: Beautiful terminal interface with tables, panels, and progress indicators
- **Async Support**: Full asynchronous operation for better performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Azure Integration**: Native Azure CLI authentication support
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands and functionality

## Installation

The CLI can be installed using the provided installation script:

```bash
# Install the CLI
./install.sh

# Or install manually
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

The CLI uses a JSON configuration file stored in `~/.vextir/config.json`:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://test-vextir.azurewebsites.net",
  "auth": {
    "method": "azure_cli",
    "tenant_id": null,
    "client_id": null
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "table",
    "colors": true,
    "verbose": false
  },
  "event_streaming": {
    "buffer_size": 100,
    "timeout": 30
  },
  "context_hub": {
    "default_path": "/",
    "max_query_results": 1000
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

All major functionality has been tested and verified:

✅ **Authentication**: Azure CLI integration working
✅ **System Status**: Successfully retrieves system health
✅ **Driver Management**: Lists drivers with status and capabilities
✅ **Model Management**: Shows available models with pricing
✅ **Context Hub**: Reads and writes context data
✅ **Configuration**: Manages CLI settings
✅ **Event Management**: Emits and lists events (network connectivity dependent)

## Usage Examples

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Check system status
vextir system status

# List recent events
vextir event list --limit 10

# Check driver status
vextir driver list

# Read important context
vextir context read /system/alerts
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Pull project context for editing
vextir hub pull /projects/myapp ./myapp-context

# Edit files locally...

# Push changes back
vextir hub push ./myapp-context

# Emit development event
vextir event emit dev.deployment --metadata '{"version": "1.2.3"}'
```

### Monitoring Workflow
```bash
# Stream events in real-time
vextir event stream &

# Monitor system metrics
vextir system metrics

# Check specific driver
vextir driver status email_agent
```

## Benefits Over Integrated UI

1. **Scriptability**: All operations can be scripted and automated
2. **Performance**: Faster than web UI for bulk operations
3. **Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing workflows and tools
4. **Offline Capability**: Many operations work without constant network connectivity
5. **Power User Features**: Advanced filtering, querying, and batch operations
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Perfect for automated deployment and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- **Shell Completion**: Add bash/zsh completion support
- **Interactive Mode**: Add interactive command mode
- **Batch Operations**: Support for batch file processing
- **Plugin System**: Allow custom command extensions
- **Configuration Profiles**: Support multiple environment profiles

## Conclusion

The Vextir OS CLI provides a complete command-line interface to the Vextir AI Operating System, offering all the functionality of the integrated UI plus additional power-user features. It successfully demonstrates that the OS can be operated entirely through CLI commands, making it suitable for automation, scripting, and power users who prefer command-line interfaces.

The implementation is production-ready and provides a robust alternative to the web-based UI for all system operations.
