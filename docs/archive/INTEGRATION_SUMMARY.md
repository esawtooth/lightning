# Event System Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the event schemas between `lightning_core/planner/validator.py` and `lightning_core/vextir_os/events.py` by creating a unified event system.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Validator Refactoring ✅
- **Organized validator architecture** with base `Validator` class
- **Parallel execution support** using `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Enhanced error reporting** with individual validator results
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing code
- **Registry system** for easy validator management

### 2. Unified Event System ✅
- **Created `lightning_core/events/` package** with centralized event definitions
- **Unified event registry** that both planner and vextir_os can use
- **Consistent event models** across the entire system
- **Backward compatibility** for both subsystems

### 3. Integration Points ✅

#### Planner Integration
- `lightning_core/planner/schema.py` now uses unified `PlannerEventModel`
- `lightning_core/planner/registry.py` uses unified `EventRegistry` via legacy interface
- Validator properly validates events against unified registry

#### Vextir OS Integration  
- `lightning_core/vextir_os/events.py` now imports from unified event system
- All existing event classes maintained for backward compatibility
- Event categories and types unified across systems

## New Architecture

```

## Key Features

### Validator Improvements
- **5 organized validators**: JSON Schema, External Events, Tools, Petri Net, Pydantic
- **Parallel execution**: 4 validators can run in parallel, 1 sequential (Petri Net)
- **Detailed results**: Individual success/failure status with error messages
- **Flexible API**: `validate_plan_new()` with parallel/sequential options

### Event System Benefits
- **14 total events registered** (4 external, 10 internal/output)
- **Centralized definitions** prevent inconsistencies
- **Type safety** with Pydantic models for planner
- **Runtime flexibility** with dataclasses for vextir_os
- **Easy extensibility** - just register new events

## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Validation
```python
# Parallel validation (default)
validate_plan_new(plan)

# Sequential validation
validate_plan_new(plan, parallel=False)

# Get detailed results
results = run_validations_parallel(plan)
for result in results:
    print(f"{result.validator_name}: {'PASS' if result.success else result.error_message}")
```

### Unified Events
```python
# Register new event
EventRegistry.register(EventDefinition(
    name="event.custom.trigger",
    category=EventCategory.EXTERNAL,
    kind="webhook",
    description="Custom webhook event"
))

# Use in planner (validates against registry)
plan_event = {"name": "event.custom.trigger", "kind": "webhook"}

# Use in vextir_os (runtime event)
runtime_event = ExternalEvent(type="event.custom.trigger", kind="webhook")
```

## Test Results

### Integration Test ✅
- ✅ 14 events registered in unified system
- ✅ 4 external events available for planner
- ✅ Legacy planner registry compatibility maintained
- ✅ Vextir OS events work with unified system
- ✅ Event categories properly unified

### Validator Test ✅
- ✅ JSON Schema validation: PASS
- ✅ External Events validation: PASS  
- ✅ Pydantic validation: PASS
- ✅ Parallel execution working
- ⚠️ Tools validation: Expected failure (test action doesn't exist)
- ⚠️ Petri Net validation: API issue (separate from integration)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with validator classes
2. **Performance**: Parallel validation where safe
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized event definitions
4. **Consistency**: Unified event system prevents schema drift
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new validators and events
6. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing code
7. **Type Safety**: Proper validation for both compile-time and runtime

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Fix Petri Net validator**: Update PM4Py API usage for proper soundness checking
2. **Add more events**: Register additional event types as needed
3. **Enhanced validation**: Add custom validators for specific business logic
4. **Performance monitoring**: Add metrics for validation performance
5. **Documentation**: Create detailed API documentation for the unified system

The integration successfully bridges the gap between the planner's schema validation needs and vextir_os's runtime event handling, providing a unified, maintainable, and extensible event system.
