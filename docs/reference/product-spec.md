* Instantly adjusts workflows based on dynamic changes in environment, context, user behavior, and external triggers.
* Supports autonomous reactions to real-time events without manual user input.

### Capability Mesh

* Executes secure, policy-controlled actions across various APIs and system services.

### Policy Firewall

* Enforces comprehensive security, privacy, and operational policies with clear, auditable logs and safeguards.

### Temporal Scheduler

* Ensures timely, reliable execution of scheduled tasks and event-driven workflows.

---

## Technical Architecture

Vextir OS is designed as a true AI operating system with clear separation between kernel services, drivers, and applications. The architecture follows traditional OS design principles adapted for AI workloads.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Everything is Event-Driven**: All communication happens through events
2. **Unified Driver Model**: All capabilities exposed through a common driver interface
3. **Applications as Data**: Workflows and UIs are configurations, not code
4. **Persistent Context**: All state managed through CR-SQLite based Context Hub
5. **Secure by Default**: Multi-tenant isolation with fine-grained permissions

## Architecture Layers

### 1. OS Kernel Layer

The kernel provides fundamental services that cannot be implemented elsewhere:

#### 1.1 Event Bus
```python
class EventBus:
    """Core message passing system"""
    
    def emit(self, event: Event) -> EventId:
        """Queue event for processing"""
        
    def subscribe(self, filter: EventFilter) -> EventStream:
        """Subscribe to event stream"""
```

**Event Categories:**
- **Input Events**: From external world (user input, sensors, APIs)
- **Internal Events**: System communication between components  
- **Output Events**: To external world (UI updates, notifications)

**Example Event:**
```json
{
    "id": "evt_123",
    "type": "email.received",
    "category": "input",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-15T12:00:00Z",
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "source": "email_driver",
    "data": {
        "from": "client@example.com",
        "subject": "Project Update",
        "body": "..."
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Context Hub (CR-SQLite)
```sql
-- Core schema using CR-SQLite for CRDT properties
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    path TEXT NOT NULL,
    content CRDT_TEXT,
    metadata CRDT_JSON,
    vector_embedding BLOB,
    permissions CRDT_JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE folders (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id TEXT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    index_guide CRDT_TEXT,
    permissions CRDT_JSON
);
```

**Example Context Operation:**
```python
# Writing to context
await context.write("/Projects/Alpha/status", {
    "phase": "development",
    "progress": 0.75,
    "last_update": "2025-06-15"
})

# Querying with SQL
results = await context.query("""
    SELECT path, content 
    FROM documents 
    WHERE path LIKE '/Projects/%' 
    AND json_extract(metadata, '$.priority') = 'high'
""")
```

#### 1.3 Scheduler
Manages time-based event emission:

```python
# One-time schedule
await scheduler.schedule_once(
    event=Event(type="report.generate"),
    at="2025-06-16T09:00:00Z"
)

# Recurring schedule
await scheduler.schedule_recurring(
    event=Event(type="standup.prepare"),
    cron="0 9 * * MON-FRI"
)
```

#### 1.4 Security Manager
- **Authentication**: Via Azure Entra ID
- **Authorization**: ACL-based permissions on context paths
- **Policy Enforcement**: Executable policies via policy agents

```python
# Example policy
policy = {
    "name": "cost_limit",
    "condition": "sum(token_usage) > 10000",
    "action": "block_expensive_models",
    "notify": ["user", "admin"]
}
```

#### 1.5 Registries

**Model Registry:**
```python
models = {
    "gpt-4": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
        "capabilities": ["chat", "function_calling"],
        "cost_per_1k_tokens": {"input": 0.03, "output": 0.06}
    },
    "claude-3": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "endpoint": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
        "capabilities": ["chat", "vision"],
        "cost_per_1k_tokens": {"input": 0.015, "output": 0.075}
    }
}
```

**Tool Registry:**
```python
tools = {
    "web_search": {
        "type": "mcp_server",
        "url": "github.com/example/search-mcp",
        "capabilities": ["search", "scrape"]
    },
    "context_read": {
        "type": "native",
        "handler": "context_hub.read"
    }
}
```

### 2. Driver Layer

All drivers implement a common interface:

```python
class Driver(ABC):
    """Base driver interface"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        """Process event and return new events"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_capabilities(self) -> List[str]:
        """List event types this driver handles"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_resource_requirements(self) -> ResourceSpec:
        """Declare resource needs"""
        pass
```

#### 2.1 Agent Drivers

LLM-powered event processors:

```python
@driver("research_agent")
class ResearchAgentDriver(Driver):
    """Research agent that gathers and synthesizes information"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ModelRegistry.get("gpt-4")
        self.tools = ["web_search", "context_read", "context_write"]
    
    def get_capabilities(self):
        return ["research.request", "question.complex"]
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        if event.type == "research.request":
            # Build prompt with context
            context = await self.read_context(f"/Research/{event.data.topic}")
            
            # Use LLM with tools
            response = await self.model.complete(
                messages=[
                    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a research assistant..."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": event.data.query}
                ],
                tools=self.tools,
                context=context
            )
            
            # Process tool calls and generate events
            output_events = []
            for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
                if tool_call.name == "web_search":
                    output_events.append(Event(
                        type="web.search",
                        data={"query": tool_call.arguments.query}
                    ))
            
            return output_events
```

**Example Agent Registration:**
```yaml
driver:
  id: email_assistant
  type: agent
  model: gpt-4
  tools: [email_read, email_send, calendar_check, context_write]
  system_prompt: |
    You are an email assistant. You help manage emails by:

    def get_capabilities(self):
        return ["github.issue.create", "github.pr.list", "github.repo.search"]
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        if event.type == "github.issue.create":
            result = await self.mcp_client.call(
                "create_issue",
                repo=event.data.repo,
                title=event.data.title,
                body=event.data.body
            )
            
            return [Event(
                type="github.issue.created",
                data={"issue_id": result.id, "url": result.url}
            )]
```

#### 2.3 IO Drivers

Interface with external systems:

```python
@driver("email_io")
class EmailIODriver(Driver):
    """Email system integration"""
    
    def get_capabilities(self):
        return ["email.fetch", "email.send", "email.watch"]
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        if event.type == "email.fetch":
            # Connect to email provider
            emails = await self.fetch_emails(
                provider=event.data.provider,
                filters=event.data.filters
            )
            
            # Emit event for each email
            return [
                Event(
                    type="email.received",
                    category="input",
                    data=email
                ) for email in emails
            ]
```

#### 2.4 UI Driver

Single daemon handling all web traffic:

```python
@driver("ui_daemon")
class UIDriver(Driver):
    """Web UI infrastructure driver"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.server = WebServer(port=3000)
        self.ui_apps = {}  # path -> UIApplication
        self.websockets = {}  # session_id -> WebSocket
    
    async def start_daemon(self):
        """Run as daemon process"""
        await self.server.start()
    
    def register_ui_app(self, path: str, app: UIApplication):
        """Mount UI application at path"""
        self.ui_apps[path] = app
        self.server.mount(path, app.handler)
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        # Route output events to connected UIs
        if event.category == "output":
            for app in self.ui_apps.values():
                if event.type in app.subscribed_events:
                    await app.update(event)
        
        return []
```

### 3. Application Layer

Applications are pure data/configuration:

#### 3.1 Instructions

User-defined workflows:

```yaml
# Example: Daily Standup Assistant
type: instruction
id: daily_standup
name: "Daily Standup Assistant"
description: "Prepares daily standup summary"

  schedule: "0 9 * * MON-FRI"
  timezone: "America/New_York"

inputs:
  - name: team_members
    type: list
    default: ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]

plan:
  # Step 1: Gather yesterday's data
  - id: fetch_emails
    action: emit_event
    event:
      type: email.fetch
      data:
        provider: gmail
        filters:

  # Step 4: Generate summary
  - id: generate_summary
    action: emit_event
    depends_on: [fetch_emails, fetch_calendar, read_tasks]
    event:
      type: research.request
      data:
        query: |
          Create a standup summary including:
          1. Key emails from yesterday
          2. Today's meetings
          3. Task progress
          4. Blockers or concerns
  
  # Step 5: Send to chat
  - id: notify_team
    action: emit_event
    depends_on: [generate_summary]
    event:
      type: chat.message
      data:
        channel: "standup"
        message: "{{generate_summary.output}}"
```

#### 3.2 Plans

DAGs generated from instructions:

```python
# Plan structure (generated by planning agent)
plan = {
    "id": "plan_123",
    "instruction_id": "daily_standup",
    "status": "executing",
    "dag": {
        "nodes": {
            "n1": {
                "action": {"type": "email.fetch", "data": {...}},
                "status": "completed",
                "output": {"emails": [...]}
            },
            "n2": {
                "action": {"type": "calendar.fetch", "data": {...}},
                "status": "running",
                "dependencies": []
            },

                "condition": "n1.output.emails.length > 0"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.3 UI Applications

Configuration-based user interfaces:

```yaml
# Example: Task Dashboard
type: ui_application
id: task_dashboard
name: "Task Dashboard"
path: "/dashboard/tasks"

layout:
  type: grid
  columns: 3
  
components:
  - id: active_tasks
    type: context_view
    config:
      path: "/Tasks/Active"
      display: cards
      refresh: 30s
      
  - id: task_timeline

    emit_event:
      type: "task.create"
      data:
        form_fields: ["title", "description", "priority"]
```

### 4. Universal Event Processor

The core event loop that powers everything:

```python
class UniversalEventProcessor:
    """Single Azure Function that processes all events"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.drivers = DriverRegistry.get_all()
        self.event_handlers = EventHandlerRegistry.get_all()
        
    async def process_event(self, event: Event) -> List[Event]:
        """Main event processing loop"""
        output_events = []
        
        # 1. Validate event
        if not self.validate_event(event):
            raise InvalidEventError(f"Invalid event: {event}")
        
        # 2. Apply security policies
        if not await self.security_manager.authorize(event):
            raise UnauthorizedError(f"Unauthorized event: {event}")
        
        # 3. Route to drivers
        for driver in self.drivers:
            if event.type in driver.get_capabilities():
                try:
                    results = await driver.handle_event(event)
                    output_events.extend(results)
                except Exception as e:
                    output_events.append(Event(
                        type="error",
                        data={"driver": driver.id, "error": str(e)}
                    ))
        
        # 4. Execute registered handlers
        if event.type in self.event_handlers:
            handler = self.event_handlers[event.type]
            context = ExecutionContext(event, self.kernel_services)
            
            try:
                results = await safe_eval(handler.code, context)
                output_events.extend(results)
            except Exception as e:
                output_events.append(Event(
                    type="error",
                    data={"handler": handler.id, "error": str(e)}
                ))
        
        # 5. Queue output events
        for output_event in output_events:
            output_event.correlation_id = event.id
            await self.event_bus.emit(output_event)
        
        # 6. Update metrics
        await self.metrics.record(event, output_events)
        
        return output_events
```

### 5. Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Email Summary Workflow

```yaml
# User creates instruction
instruction:
  name: "Morning Email Summary"
  trigger:
    schedule: "0 8 * * *"
  plan:
    - emit: {type: "email.fetch", data: {since: "yesterday"}}
    - emit: {type: "email.summarize"}
    - emit: {type: "chat.message", data: {channel: "personal"}}
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Scheduler emits event at 8 AM
2. Email IO driver fetches emails
3. Email agent driver summarizes
4. UI driver updates chat interface

#### Scenario 2: Meeting Preparation

```python
# When calendar event detected
Event(type="calendar.meeting.upcoming", data={
    "meeting_id": "mtg_123",
    "title": "Q3 Planning",
    "attendees": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
    "time": "2025-06-15T14:00:00Z"
})

# Triggers preparation workflow
# 1. Research agent gathers context
# 2. Reads previous meeting notes
# 3. Checks action items
# 4. Prepares agenda
# 5. Sends to participants
```

#### Scenario 3: Custom Tool Integration

```python
# Third-party contributes weather tool
@driver("weather_tool")
class WeatherDriver(Driver):
    def get_capabilities(self):
        return ["weather.get", "weather.forecast"]
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        if event.type == "weather.get":
            data = await self.api.get_weather(event.data.location)
            return [Event(type="weather.data", data=data)]

# User creates weather dashboard
ui_app = {
    "type": "ui_application",
    "path": "/weather",
    "components": [{
        "type": "event_view",
        "subscribe": ["weather.data"],
        "template": "weather_card.html"
    }]
}

# User creates weather automation
instruction = {
    "name": "Severe Weather Alert",
    "trigger": {"event": "weather.severe"},
    "plan": [
        {"emit": {"type": "notification.urgent"}},
        {"emit": {"type": "context.write", "path": "/Alerts/Weather"}}
    ]
}
```

### 6. Development Workflow

#### Creating a New Driver

```python
# 1. Implement driver interface
class CustomDriver(Driver):
    def get_capabilities(self):
        return ["custom.action"]
    
    async def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        # Process event
        return [Event(type="custom.result", data={...})]

# 2. Register driver
driver_manifest = {
    "id": "custom_driver_v1",
    "name": "Custom Driver",
    "author": "developer@example.com",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": ["custom.action"],
    "resource_requirements": {
        "memory": "512MB",
        "timeout": "30s"
    }
}

# 3. Deploy
await DriverRegistry.register(driver_manifest, CustomDriver)
```

#### Creating a UI Application

```yaml
# weather_dashboard.yaml
type: ui_application
id: weather_dashboard
name: "Weather Dashboard"
author: "developer@example.com"

components:
  - type: current_weather
    data_source: 
      event: "weather.current"
    template: |
      <div class="weather-card">
        <h2>{{location}}</h2>
        <div class="temp">{{temperature}}Â°</div>
        <div class="conditions">{{conditions}}</div>
      </div>

### 7. Security Model

#### Multi-tenant Isolation

```python
# Each event carries user context
event = Event(
    type="context.read",
    user_id="user_123",
    data={"path": "/Personal/Notes"}
)

# Security manager validates access
class SecurityManager:
    async def authorize(self, event: Event) -> bool:
        # Check user owns the path
        if event.type.startswith("context."):
            path = event.data.get("path")
            return await self.check_path_access(event.user_id, path)
        
        # Check user can use driver
        driver = self.get_driver_for_event(event)
        return await self.check_driver_access(event.user_id, driver)
```

#### Policy Enforcement

```python
# Cost control policy
policy = Policy(
    name="token_limit",
    condition="daily_tokens > 100000",
    action="restrict_to_cheap_models",
    applies_to=["user_123"]
)

# Data sensitivity policy  
policy = Policy(
    name="pii_protection",
    condition="context_path.contains('/Personal')",
    action="block_external_apis",
    applies_to=["*"]
)
```
